# Reverse-Array-Function
This project demonstrates a solution to the "Reverse an Array" challenge, where the goal is to reverse the order of integers in an array. It is a basic algorithmic exercise, suitable for practicing data structure manipulation and algorithm design.

## Problem Statement

An array is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. Each element can be accessed via its index.

## Objective:

Reverse the elements of an integer array.

## Example:

### Input:

Array size: 4\
Array elements: 1 4 3 2

### Output:

Reversed array: 2 3 4 1

## Function Description

The solution implements the reverseArray function, which performs the following:

- Takes an integer array as input.
- Returns the reversed version of the input array.

## Function Signature:

``` cpp

int[] reverseArray(int A[], int n);

```

## Parameters:

- int A[n]: the array to reverse.
- int n: the size of the array.

## Returns:

- int[n]: the reversed array.
